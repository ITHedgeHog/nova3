# Nova NextGen Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Nova NextGen! Please review the entire guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Open Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting new feature requests, consider whether it might be useful to others. Just because your game would benefit from a feature doesn't mean it's in the best interest of the wider community. Open source projects, like Nova, are used by a wide range of users who may have entirely different needs from your own. Think about whether or not your feature request is likely to be used by others. Anything that we consider to be specific to your or a small subset of games will not be merged into the Nova core.

## Issues

To encourage active collaboration, we strongly encourage pull requests be sent with fixes to any issues, not just bug reports.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample or link that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and work toward developing a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

## Nova NextGen Development Discussion

Discussion regarding issues, new features, and ongoing development takes place in the [Nova NextGen forum][nextgen-forum]. Posts to the forums are generally answered within 24 hours of posting.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Nova NextGen, please send an email to contact@anodyne-productions.com. Due to the potentially sensitive nature of security vulnerabilities, we would ask that you do not post about security vulnerabilities on the public forums. All security vulnerabilities, once verified, will be promptly addressed.

## Coding Style

Nova follows the [PSR-1][psr-1] coding standard and the [PSR-4][psr-4] autoloading standard. Portions of vendor code follows the [PSR-2][psr-2] coding standard, but the Nova core itself does not. Please do not submit PSR-2 code to the Nova core!
