__How do I reorder form tabs/sections/fields from a phone or tablet?__

The only way to reorder form tabs, form sections and form fields when you're on a mobile phone or tablet is to edit the item and manually change the order.

__How do I reorder form field values from a phone or tablet?__

There is no way to reorder form field values from a mobile phone or tablet. You will need to use a computer to make any order changes to form field values.

__Why can I delete some forms and not others?__

Forms that ship with Nova by default (character, user, app) are protected forms and cannot be deleted.

__Why can I fill out some forms and not others?__

Admins can choose whether or not to allow FormViewer to be used a form (protected forms cannot use FormViewer). Only forms that are set to use FormViewer will show the option to fill out the form and view its entries.

__Why can I delete some users/characters and not others?__

Users and characters can only be deleted if there is no content associated with them. Content that will prevent deletion are: announcements, personal logs, mission posts, received awards, application reviews, wiki pages and forum posts.
