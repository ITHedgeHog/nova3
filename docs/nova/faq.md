### How do I reorder form field values from a phone or tablet?

There is no way to reorder form field values from a mobile phone or tablet. You will need to use a computer to make any order changes to form field values.

### Why can I delete some forms and not others?

Forms that ship with Nova by default (character, user, app) are protected forms and cannot be deleted.

### Why can I fill out some forms and not others?

Admins can choose whether or not to allow FormViewer to be used a form (protected forms cannot use FormViewer). Only forms that are set to use FormViewer will show the option to fill out the form and view its entries.
