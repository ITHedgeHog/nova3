# PHP 101

Whenever someone is learning PHP, the most common questions are _what is PHP_ and _how does it work_. We're going to look at that as well as some basic concepts that are important to understand when it comes to PHP. These are the foundation of learning how to work with PHP, even in small doses.

In the simplest of terms, PHP is just a programming language that lets you create dynamic pages on a web server. Unlike HTML which the server sends back without doing anything, with PHP, the server has to do some work before it can send anything back to the browser. Being able to do processing on the server is what gives PHP its power.

It's important to note that PHP only sends the _output_ back to the browser, not the actual PHP instructions. That means if you view the source of a PHP page in the browser, you'll only see the final output, not any PHP code. (This can be a stumbling block for people new to PHP since they want to see the PHP code that's being run. In order to see that, you have to have access to the actual PHP file.)

Since PHP is a server-side programming language, it means that you need to have a server running in order to play around with PHP. To do this, you can either use your web server or create a small server on your computer using a variety of different programs (depending on your operating system):

- Windows
	- (AMPPS)[http://www.ampps.com/]
	- (WAMP)[http://www.wampserver.com/en/]
- OS X
	- (MAMP)[http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html]
	- AMPPS is available for OS X, but we recommend sticking with MAMP.
- Linux
	- (XAMPP)[http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html]

You can download any of the above programs and use their instructions to install and start running the server. Once you've done that, come back here and we'll dive in to getting started with PHP!

Make sure that when you download any of these programs that they have at least PHP 5.4 available for use, otherwise you won't be able to install Nova 3 locally to be able to play around with it.

## Variables

The simplest of concepts when it comes to PHP is _variables_. A variable holds some content. That content can be just about anything you want. Generally, a variable will contain text (string), numbers (integer), yes/no (boolean) or a collection of information (arrays and objects). Here are a few things to remember when creating variables in PHP:

- Variables starts with the `$` sign, followed by the name of the variable.
- Variable names _must_ start with a letter or underscore.
- Variable names can only contain letters, numbers and an underscore.
- Variable names cannot contain spaces.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`$x` and `$X` are two different variables).
- Strings

<pre>// Putting text into a variable
$text = 'A string of text';

// Putting a number into a variable
$number = 15;

// Putting a yes (true) or no (false) value into a variable
$yesNo = true;

// Putting an array into a variable
$array = ['one', 'two', 'three'];</pre>
