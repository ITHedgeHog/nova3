# Interfaces

Simply put, an interface is a contract between the developer and the system they're developing for. An interface defines certain methods that a developers class _must_ have, but gives the developer the freedom to build those classes how they see fit.

- An interface defines public methods that a class must implement.
- An interface does not contain any code.
- Classes can implement multiple interfaces.

For Nova 3, we've taken this concept and run with it to provide developers with the freedom to have their own code do some of the same things the Nova core does.
