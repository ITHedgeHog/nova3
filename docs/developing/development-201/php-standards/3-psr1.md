# PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard

(View the full text of PSR-1)[http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/]

PSR-1 focuses on basic coding styles, specifically refraining from being too specific. These rules are there to ensure a high level of technical interoperability between shared PHP code.

Nova 3 fully adheres to PSR-1. Any code submitted to Anodyne should also adhere to these standards.
