# PSRs

PHP has never truly had a uniform standard for writing code. Each developer tends to go their own direction with their coding standards, creating a mess of different styles and ways of doing things. In the wake of growing frustrations between frameworks and projects, the PHP Framework Interop Group was formed to help create standards for PHP community projects. These standards help ensure that more and more projects are doing things the same way. This creates continuity between projects, makes it simpler to pick up and understand new projects and provides tools (like Composer) that can be used to inject framework-agnostic components into other projects.

What came out of the PHP-FIG were a series of PSRs, or PHP Standards Recommendations. As of today, there are 4 PSRs.
