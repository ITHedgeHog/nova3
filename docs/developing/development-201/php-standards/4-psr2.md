# PSR-2: Coding Style Guide

(View the full text of PSR-2)[http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/]

PSR-2 expands on PSR-1 by defining coding styles to be used by projects. Because of differences in opinion between what "looks" best when it comes to coding styles, many projects don't fully adhere to PSR-2.

Anodyne's coding style guidelines are slightly different and therefore do not comply with PSR-2. Any code submitted to Anodyne should adhere to our coding style, not PSR-2.
