# Composer Packages

There are many ways to find Composer packages, but the easiest are in the readme.md files of GitHub repositories, in the library or framework documentation and by searching http://packagist.org.

More and more library authors are creating their own composer.json files and submitting their libraries to Packagist. They will usually explain how to use their libraries as a dependency, but it also helps to check any composer.json files you see in GitHub repositories.

Searching Packagist is a little harder if you don’t know what you are looking for, but a search for “http” quickly returned many results (including Guzzle). Give it a shot if you can’t find what you need using GitHub’s search function.
