# Core Model Events

At first glance, it can look like Nova is conjuring some black magic when certain things happen. This can be especially frustrating if you're trying to figure out why Y happened when you did X. One of the places to start is with Nova's model events. At certain points during the execution of the model, things happen behind the scenes.

Below is an exhaustive list of what happens with different models and the events on those models.

		- override the default system event call to make sure the character information is properly entered
- Comment
	- saving
		- make sure the `commentable_type` is a non-namespaced version of the class (essentially just the alias)

		- if the form isn't protected, delete everything related to that particular form (data, field values, fields, sections and tabs)
- Form\Field
