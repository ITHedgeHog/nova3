# Responsive Design

At the heart of Nova 3's design philosophy is an approach called _responsive design._

In the simplest terms, responsive design aims to create sites that provide the best possible viewing experience across a wide range of devices (everything from a desktop computer to a mobile phone). That means the same markup is used regardless of the device you're viewing the page on, but the stylesheets involved dictate how things are laid out depending on the device you're using.

Given the fact that more and more people are using Nova from phones and tablets, we felt it was imperative that Nova 3 be as easy to use on a wide array of devices as possible. Using responsive design techniques, we've been able to create a better experience for users, regardless of how they're viewing Nova.

## Targeting Specific Devices

Because of the very nature of responsive design, it's possible for you to target specific types of devices and make changes just for those devices. The pages below will show you how to target mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers to ensure your skin works flawlessly on all devices.
