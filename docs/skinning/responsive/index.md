# Responsive Design

At the heart of Nova 3's design philosophy is an approached called _responsive design._ In the simplest terms, responsive design aims to create sites that provide the best possible viewing experience across a wide range of devices (everything from a desktop computer to a mobile phone). That means the same markup is used regardless of the device you're viewing the page on, but the stylesheets involved dicatate how things are laid out depending on the device you're using. This approach in Nova 3 allows us to create a significantly better experience for users regardless of how they're viewing Nova.

## Bootstrap 3

In previous versions of Nova, we've employed components from the Bootstrap toolkit to help us handle more complex interactions (tooltips, popovers, etc.). In Nova 3, all of Anodyne's skins use Bootstrap from top to bottom.

If there's another tool you'd rather use or roll your own grid system, you're welcome to do so. Despite that though, the core view files many of Bootstrap's components, including the grid system.</p>

## Targeting Specific Devices

Because of the very nature of responsive design, it's possible for you to target specific types of devices and make changes just for those devices. The pages below will show you how to target mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers to ensure your skin works flawlessly on all devices.
