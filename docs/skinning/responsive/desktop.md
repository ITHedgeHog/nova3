# Responsive Design - Desktop Computers

It seems that just about everyone has a smartphone today.

## Targeting Desktop Computers for your Skins

If you want to hide something from being seen on a desktop, you can use the `hidden-lg` class. If you want to show something just on a desktop, you can use the `visible-lg` class.

Bootstrap's grid system also has triggers for creating columns on a desktop. To create a column on a desktop, use the `col-lg-*` classes.

<pre>&lt;div class="row">
	&lt;div class="col-lg-6">&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class="col-lg-6">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

&lt;div class="row">
	&lt;div class="col-lg-12">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>
