* Bootstrap Lightbox

* jQuery Chosen
	* Chosen doesn't work well on mobile devices, so it's important that any solution we have work well across all platforms and devices.
* jQuery Controls
	* Used in dialog2
* jQuery dialog2
	* We can accomplish most of what they do through Bootstrap's modal dialog box.
* jQuery Form
	* Used in dialog2
* jQuery Editable
	* This doesn't get updated ever, so I'd like to move to something that's maintained a little better.
