<p>It isn't enough to just release powerful, easy-to-use software, you also need to maintain it. Our goal is to continually make Nova better than it was before, be it fixing bugs or adding new features. The best way to make sure you're getting the most out of Nova is to keep up with the updates that we release.</p>
	
<p>The links below provide information about how to update Nova 3 as well as the changelog for Nova. If you have additional questions, please visit the <a href="http://forums.anodyne-productions.com" target="_blank">Anodyne forums</a> for more help.</p>

<p>Before you begin though, it's <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you backup both your files and your database. At Anodyne, we make sure to test all of the Nova updates before releasing them, but there is only so much we can test for. In the end, it's better to be safe rather than sorry.</p>
