	"summary": "Nova 3.0.1 addresses issues found after the launch of Nova 3.0, including a rare issue that would cause some GMs to turn into purple elephants. We apologize for any inconveniences this may have caused admins.",
	"notes": "- Created a new `Mail` wrapper class around SwiftMailer for better email handling than CodeIgniter's built-in email class. Thanks to forum user TheDrew for helping us sort through some of these issues.\n\n## Nova Core\n- Updated the controllers with the new Mail class calls.\n- We've removed all the reply-to calls with emails since more and more spam filters are checking the reply-to headers as well as the from header.\n- Added a notice to the bottom of all emails that it's an automated email and they shouldn't reply to the message.\n- Updated the manifest Javascript to remove hard-coded calls to a table structure. This has become problematic as people have begun to modify the manifest to have less traditional layouts.\n- Updated the error language file with a new error message.\n\n## Fixed Issues\n- When there is no manifest metadata, an extra space is displayed.\n- Fixed issue where users could view pending and saved mission posts, personal logs, and news items from their respective view pages.",
