<p>HTTP defines methods (often referred to as <em>verbs</em>) to indicate action to be taken on a specific resource.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>GET</dt>
	<dd>Simply put, a GET request, well, <em>gets</em> data from a server. In most cases, a GET request should only retrieve data.</dd>

	<dt>POST</dt>
	<dd>A POST request actually sends data to the server and expects something back. Most often this is used for submitting forms to create data on the server or in the database.</dd>

	<dt>PUT</dt>
	<dd>If the URI refers to an already existing resource, a PUT request takes its data and tries to replace that data for the specific resource. This is most often used for updating existing pieces of data on the server or in the database.</dd>

	<dt>DELETE</dt>
	<dd>Pretty self-explanatory, but a DELETE request takes a given resource and tells the server it wants to remove it from the server or database.</dd>
